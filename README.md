# Attendance-System-Using-Face-Recognition-in-Real-Time-Database
This repository provides an attendance system implemented using face recognition technology and a real-time database. The system allows for efficient and accurate tracking of attendance by recognizing individuals' faces and storing the attendance data in a database in real-time.
Key Features
Face Detection: The system employs robust face detection algorithms to locate and extract facial regions from live video streams or images.

Face Recognition: Extracted faces are matched against a pre-registered database of known faces to recognize individuals.

Real-Time Database: A real-time database is integrated to store attendance records, including timestamps and recognized individuals' identities.

Attendance Tracking: The system tracks attendance by comparing recognized faces with the registered database and updates attendance records in real-time.

User Management: The project provides functionality to register new individuals, update their information in the database, and assign unique identities or labels for identification.

Attendance Reports: The system generates comprehensive attendance reports, including attendance statistics, individual attendance records, and summaries for specific time periods.

Notifications: Automated notifications can be sent to individuals or administrators for attendance-related events, such as late arrivals or absences.

User Interface: The project offers a user-friendly interface for administrators and users to interact with the system, view attendance records, manage users, and access reports.
